# RPA UiPath
The goal of this project is to create a collection of mp3 files of songs from the "Liked Songs" playlist in the Spotify user account. The process has three distinguishable parts:
- scrap the playlist info (artist - title) from Spotify
- find song videos in the web
- convert video links to mp3 and download.
